//TEMPLATE LITERALS 

/*Synonyms:
Template Literals
Template Strings
String Templates
Back-Tics Syntax*/

//Template literals let you embed values into a string without relying on concatenation.
//To declare a template literal, your string must be enclosed in back ticks (â€œ) instead of quotation marks.

//Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
//The method is called string interpolation.

//Automatic replacing of variables with real values is called string interpolation.
//Automatic replacing of expressions with real values is called string interpolation.
